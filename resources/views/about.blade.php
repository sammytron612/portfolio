        <p>I'm a versatile, multi-disciplined IT professional with a genuine passion for technology and a strong interest in coding and scripting. My career has given me hands-on experience across technical support, systems administration, networking, and web development, allowing me to approach challenges with both breadth and depth.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">Starting from 1st line and progressing through to 3rd line support, I've consistently helped users and businesses stay productive by resolving technical issues efficiently and empathetically. I’ve also improved workflows through automation and scripting, using tools like PowerShell and Python, and by developing custom applications tailored to specific needs</p>
        <p class="mt-4">My background includes working confidently across both Windows Server and Linux environments, managing hybrid infrastructures, and supporting enterprise tools such as Office 365 and Active Directory. I bring a developer’s mindset to IT operations, having built web applications using PHP with Laravel, JavaScript, MySQL, MSSQL, and Python. I’ve also configured and secured networks using Cisco technologies and other vendor solutions, ensuring robust and reliable connectivity.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">Recently, I completed a 12-week instructor-led training course focused on building scalable solutions on AWS, and I’m currently preparing to earn the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification. This experience has deepened my understanding of cloud architecture and expanded my ability to deliver modern, scalable solutions.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">Whether it's automating workflows, optimizing performance, or troubleshooting complex systems, I thrive on solving problems and making technology work smarter. I approach every challenge with curiosity, creativity, and a commitment to continuous improvement.</p>
