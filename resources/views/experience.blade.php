                        <p>I designed and deployed the full IT infrastructure for an 800-seat call centre, delivering a secure and scalable environment. The network was built using Cisco Meraki switches and a WatchGuard firewall, with VLANs configured for efficient traffic segmentation. I set up three Hyper-V hosts running Windows and Linux servers, supporting services like Active Directory, Exchange, File and Print, Microsoft Deployment Server, IIS, MSSQL, and Laravel-based PHP applications.
